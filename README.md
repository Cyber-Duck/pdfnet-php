# PDFTron - PDFNetPHP Library generated by SWIG for PHP 5.6.30

This file was automatically generated by [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) following the
guidelines from [PDFTron/PDFNetWrappers](https://github.com/PDFTron/PDFNetWrappers).

PDFTron is a very powerful web-based PDF viewer.

PDFTron needs PDF files to be transformed into XOD files before being used for
rendering.

This library can be used on the server side in order to transform PDF into XOD.

It has been generated for PHP 5.6.30 by using [PDFTron/PDFNetWrappers](https://github.com/PDFTron/PDFNetWrappers)
and will require `PDFNetPHP.so` PHP extension to be installed. Both the extension
`PDFNetPHP.so` and the library `PDFNetPHP.php` files can be generated or
re-generated following [PDFTron/PDFNetWrappers](https://github.com/PDFTron/PDFNetWrappers)
recommendations.
